# Project Labyrinth

A maze game built in React and Redux using Redux Thunks and Styled Components.

The project is built by Mimmi Fordal Uddin, Suki Nhung Phan and Emma HÃ¶gberg.

## The problem

We started to get a common understaning of the project requirements and what to build. We used Figma to brainstorm the functionalities and do a prototype for our design.

A Kanban board and Slack was used for communication. We coded the foundation of the game together and later we splitted up tasks and worked in branches. During the way we meet up regularly and developed our ideas and took decision for the project direction.
